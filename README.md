## Project Overview

VoxWeb: A Speech-Enabled Automatic Website Building System  is a software solution designed to simplify and streamline the process of creating web pages through voice recognition technology.

## Getting Started

Explain how to get your Django app up and running on a local development environment. This section should include details on prerequisites, installation steps, and any additional setup that may be required.

### Prerequisites

List the software and tools that users need to have installed before they can run your Django app. Here's an example:

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Any other dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robymarManaloto/voxweb.git  --recurse-submodules
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-django-app
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Your Django app should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can access the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ using the superuser credentials you created.

## Usage

Explain how to use your Django app, including any user roles, functionality, and how to access specific features. If there are any important configuration settings, provide guidance on how to modify them.

## Folder Structure

Describe the organization of your project's folders and files. Provide an overview of the purpose of each major directory in your Django app.

## Contributing

Encourage others to contribute to your project by providing guidelines for how they can submit bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Include information on the preferred coding style, development workflow, and any other relevant details.

## License

Specify the license under which your Django app is distributed. For example, if you're using an open-source license, include a link to the license text.
